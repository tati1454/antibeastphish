# Antibeastphish discord bot.

## What is Beastphish?
Beastphish is a phishing project that started in early 2021, in which people are recruited to buy domains and bind them to IPs where the phishing servers are hosted \
and then these people have to share their link to the phishing and try to steal as many accounts as possible. In return, they make a profit from selling the accounts \
and the recruits get a commission from these profits.

## What does this bot do?
What this bot does is to look for URLs that point to some of the phishing IP addresses and then ban the user who sent the message and delete the message.
